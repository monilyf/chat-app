Integrating Socket.IO

- Socket.IO is composed of two parts:
    1) A server that integrates with the NodeJS HTTP server socket.IO
    2) A client library that loads on the browser side socket.io-client

- During development, socket.io servers the client automatically for us
- npm install socket.io (for server)
- npm install socket.io-client (for client)
